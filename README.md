The primary objectives of this project are to predict the global sales of video games based on the given dataset as well as classify and cluster video games using categorical variables.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
      - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
      - Balanced the dataset to address any class imbalance issues.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative visualizations, using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present the census data in a clear and informative manner.
- **Modelling**:
      - Employed various regression models to predict global sales.
      - Used classification algorithms to classify video games based on categorical variables.
      - Performed clustering to group video games and evaluated the clusters.
      - Conducted hyperparameter grid tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluation**:
      - Evaluated models using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
      - Used cross-validation and other techniques to check for overfitting.

## Conclusion
The project successfully identified key predictors of global video game sales and evaluated various models for classification and clustering. The findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing video game sales and the potential for deploying predictive models in practice.
